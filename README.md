# FactionGolem
 Minecraft spigot plugin that uses Factions plugin to create golems for player factions!
 
*This plugin was made by me back in late 2017 or somewhere during that time frame, I had this in my hard drive and never bothered touching this again so it may contain unoptimized and messy code.*
**I do not work with Java or minecraft plugins on a regular basis or in general anymore.**

*You are free to use this wherever you want as long as the credits for this is given, that is me.*

# Setup instructions will not be provided as this is an abandoned project and I have not touched this in years nor mean to.
# This project is only useful for people who develop plugins or know how to build, not for server owners.
